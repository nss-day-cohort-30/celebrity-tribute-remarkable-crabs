                <h2>Early Days</h2>
                <p>Grace Brewster Murray was born on December 9, 1906 in New York City, USA. Hopper was her married
                    surname.</p>
                <p>Her father was Walter Fletcher Murray, an insurance executive; and her mother was the mathematically
                    talented Mary Campbell Van Horne. The couple had three children; Grace Brewster Murray, Dr. Roger
                    Franklin
                    Murray, and Mary Murray. Grace was the eldest.</p>

                    Grace grew up in an academic atmosphere – her parents made sure she had access to all the books she
                    wanted,
                    and they did everything they possibly could to support her curious nature.
                    Grace’s father raised his daughters and his son to value education, self-reliance, and hard work;
                    and
                    he
                    urged them to always pursue their dreams.
                </p>
                <p>Grace was educated privately at two conservative Presbyterian girls’ schools in New York: The Graham
                    School
                    and Miss Mary Schoonmaker’s School. At age 17, Grace had already
                    decided to major in mathematics. Her professors noticed she was unusually skilled at explaining
                    difficult
                    concepts in math and physics to other students.</p>

                <h2>Higher Education and Marrige</h2>
                <p><img src="images/grace3.JPG" class="personalImg" alt="Grace Murry" title="Grace Murry" /> 1928, at
                    age
                    21, Grace graduated from a Vassar College, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and
                    physics. Two years later she received a master’s degree in mathematics from Yale. This was, also,
                    the
                    year
                    she married Vincent Hopper, whom she divorced in in 1945. She did not marry again, but chose to
                    keep
                    the
                    surname.</p>
                <p>Grace accepted work as a mathematics assistant at Vassar College in 1931. While teaching, she went
                    on to
                    earn her PHD in 1934. She continued working at Vassar, where she was eventually promoted to
                    associate
                    professor.</p>

                <p><img src="images/Grace4.jpg" class="personalImg" alt="Grace Hopper" title="Grace Hopper" />
                    Following Japan’s
                    attack on Pearl Harbor in November 1941, Grace attempted to join the military, but she was
                    repeatedly denied. In 1943, however, her relentlessness paid off, and she was accepted into the Naval
                    Reserve.
                    This was the beginning of the 43 years she spent paving the way for computing as we know it today.
                    In
                    1986,
                    she retired as a rear admiral. She was the oldest serving officer in service. She never fully
                    retired
                    from
                    computing, though. She worked as an industry consultant to the end of her life.</p>
                <p>Grace died in her sleep, age 85, of natural causes, on January 1, 1992 in Berkeley, California.</p>
