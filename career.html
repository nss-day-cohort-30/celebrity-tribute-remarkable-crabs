   <h1>Grace Hopper's Career</h1>
 <div class="infoContainer">
      Hopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in World War II. She was rejected for
      multiple reasons. At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio
      was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and
      mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort.[18] During
      the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into
      the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve
      in the WAVES. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg)
      below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg). She reported in December and
      trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton,
      Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to
      the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant,
      junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by
      Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also
      known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer
      to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38.
      She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation
      Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a
      research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.[19]
